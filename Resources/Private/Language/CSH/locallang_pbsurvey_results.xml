                can, for instance, exclude this result that was meant for testing purposes only.

            <label index="user.details">When a questionaire has been taken among logged-in frontend users, the user who
                participated will be displayed here.

                When a questionaire has been taken anonymously, this field will be empty.

                This field will be used by the module &quot;Web &gt; Questionaire&quot; to extract the users personal
                information from the table &quot;fe_users&quot; and insert this information in the csv file.

            <label index="finished.details">The result record is always made in the beginning of a survey, when the user
                sends the form of the first page back to the website. At the end of the survey this flag will be
                checked. This flag is important to make a difference between finished and unfinished surveys when
                exporting the results or generating backend statistics.

            <label index="begintstamp.description">The start date and time of this result.</label>
            <label index="begintstamp.details">At the beginning of a survey the start time and date is written to the
                result record. At the end the end date and time is written to the record. With these two values you can
                determine how long it took for users to participate in the survey.

                &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; When the survey is updatable it is possible there is a strange
                difference between the start and end time. The start date can be later then the end date. This is
                because a user updated his own answers but didn't finish the update session.
